# Asynchronous control flow patterns

## Event emitters

Event emitters are a fundamental communication mechanism in Node.js for building applications that can react to events. Here are some key subtopics to explore when learning about event emitters:

1. **Concepts:**

   - **Event:** A signal that something has happened within the application.
   - **Emitter:** An object that can emit (trigger) events.
   - **Listener:** A function that is registered to be called when a specific event is emitted.
   - **Event Name:** A string that identifies the type of event being emitted.

2. **Core functionalities:**

   - **Emitting Events:** Using the `emit` method on an emitter object to trigger an event and notify registered listeners.
   - **Listening to Events:** Using the `on` or `once` method on an emitter object to register a listener function for a specific event.
   - **Removing Listeners:** Using the `off` method to remove a previously registered listener.

3. **Event Arguments (Optional):**

   - Events can optionally pass arguments to the listener functions, providing additional context about the event.

4. **Error Handling:**

   - Consider proper error handling mechanisms when working with event emitters, especially for unexpected events or errors within listener functions.

5. **Common Use Cases:**

   - Implementing real-time communication features (e.g., chat applications).
   - Coordinating tasks between different parts of your application.
   - Building modular and reusable components that can communicate through events.

6. **The `EventEmitter` Class:**

   - Node.js provides a built-in `EventEmitter` class that you can inherit from to create custom emitters with event handling functionalities.

7. **Popular Third-Party Event Emitters:**

   - While the built-in `EventEmitter` is widely used, libraries like `eventemitter3` offer additional features and enhancements.

8. **Best Practices:**
   - Use descriptive event names that clearly convey the meaning of the event.
   - Organize your event listeners to avoid cluttering your code.
   - Consider using event object arguments to provide context to listeners.

### Concepts

**1. Events and Signals:**

- Imagine your Node.js application as a bustling city. Events are like signals or happenings within the city. These signals could be anything from a user clicking a button to a database operation completing.

**2. Emitters and Listeners:**

- Think of event emitters as the city's communication hubs. These objects can trigger (emit) events to notify other parts of the application.
- Listeners are like the city residents who are interested in specific events. They register themselves with the emitter to be notified when those events occur.

**3. Event Names:**

- Events are identified by unique names (strings) that describe what's happening. For example, an event name could be "userClickedButton" or "databaseOperationComplete".

**Here's an analogy to solidify these concepts:**

- Imagine a shopping mall (emitter) with a security system (event). When a sensor detects motion (event trigger), the security system emits an "intrusionDetected" event.
- Shops in the mall (listeners) can register to listen for this event. Upon receiving the event notification, shops might activate their alarm systems (listener function) as a response.

**Key Points:**

- An emitter can emit multiple events with different names.
- A listener can be registered for one or more events.
- Events can optionally carry additional information (arguments) when emitted, providing context to the listener functions.

### Core functionalities

1. **Emitting Events:**

   - This involves triggering an event from an emitter object to notify registered listeners.
   - The `emit` method is used for this purpose. It takes the event name as the first argument and optional arguments (data) as additional parameters.

   ```javascript
   const emitter = new EventEmitter();

   // Emit an event named 'message' with some data
   emitter.emit("message", { content: "Hello from the emitter!" });
   ```

2. **Listening to Events:**

   - Listeners are functions that are executed when a specific event is emitted.
   - You use the `on` or `once` method on an emitter object to register a listener function for a particular event name.

     - `on`: The listener function will be called whenever the specified event is emitted. The listener remains registered until explicitly removed.

     - `once`: The listener function will be called only the first time the specified event is emitted. It automatically removes itself after the first invocation.

   ```javascript
   emitter.on("message", (message) => {
     console.log("Received message:", message.content);
   });
   ```

3. **Removing Listeners:**

   - You might want to unregister listeners when they are no longer needed to avoid unnecessary function calls.
   - The `off` method is used to remove a previously registered listener function. It takes the event name and the listener function itself as arguments.

   ```javascript
   const listenerToRemove = (message) => {
     console.log("Another listener:", message.content);
   };

   emitter.on("message", listenerToRemove);

   // Later, remove the listener
   emitter.off("message", listenerToRemove);
   ```

**Event Arguments (Optional):**

- As mentioned earlier, events can optionally pass arguments to the listener functions. These arguments provide additional context about the event.
- In the `emit` method, you can specify any data you want to send along with the event name. The listener function receives these arguments when it's called.

**Error Handling:**

- It's essential to consider proper error handling when working with event emitters. This includes:
  - Handling potential errors within the emitter's `emit` method if the event name is invalid or there are issues with arguments.
  - Handling errors that might occur inside listener functions, as unhandled errors can crash your application.

### Event arguments

- When you emit an event using the `emit` method on an emitter object, you can include additional arguments after the event name. These arguments can be any data type (strings, numbers, objects, etc.).

```javascript
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.emit("orderPlaced", { orderId: 123, items: ["product1", "product2"] });
```

- In the listener function registered for that event, you can access these arguments to understand the specific details of the event.

```javascript
emitter.on("orderPlaced", (order) => {
  console.log("Order ID:", order.orderId);
  console.log("Items ordered:", order.items);
});
```

**Benefits of Event Arguments:**

- **Richer Context:** Event arguments allow you to provide more information about the event, enabling listeners to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.
- **Flexibility:** You can customize the data you send with each event, making your communication system more adaptable to different scenarios.
- **Code Reusability:** By using event arguments, you can create generic listener functions that can handle events with varying data structures, improving code reusability.

**Example: Shopping Cart Update Event:**

Imagine an e-commerce application where you have an event emitter for a shopping cart. You could emit an event named "itemAdded" with arguments containing the product details:

```javascript
emitter.emit("itemAdded", { productId: 456, name: "T-Shirt" });
```

The listener function for this event could then use these arguments to update the cart display or perform other actions based on the added product.

**Best Practices:**

- Clearly document the expected format and meaning of event arguments for better collaboration and maintainability.
- Avoid sending excessive data with events, as large payloads can impact performance.
- Consider using well-defined object structures for event arguments to improve clarity and organization.

### Error handling

Error handling is crucial when working with event emitters in Node.js to ensure your application remains stable and responsive in the face of unexpected issues.

**1. Potential Errors:**

- There are two main areas where errors can arise with event emitters:
  - **Emitter Errors:** These occur during the `emit` method call itself. This could happen if you provide an invalid event name or encounter issues with the arguments you pass.
  - **Listener Errors:** These occur within the listener functions themselves. Unhandled errors in listener functions can crash your application.

**2. Error Handling in `emit` Method:**

- While less common, it's good practice to handle potential errors when emitting events. You can use a `try...catch` block around the `emit` call:

```javascript
try {
  emitter.emit("invalidEventName"); // This might cause an error
} catch (err) {
  console.error("Error emitting event:", err.message);
  // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., log the error, recover gracefully)
}
```

**3. Error Handling in Listener Functions:**

- It's essential to handle errors within your listener functions to prevent them from crashing your application. You can use a `try...catch` block within the listener function:

```javascript
emitter.on("someEvent", (data) => {
  try {
    // Process the event data
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error in listener function:", err.message);
    // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., log the error, emit a different event)
  }
});
```

**4. Best Practices:**

- Always handle errors within listener functions, especially if they involve critical operations or might throw errors due to invalid data.
- Consider using a centralized error logging mechanism to capture and track errors related to event emitters.
- In some cases, you might want to emit a separate error event if a listener function encounters an error, notifying other parts of your application.

### The EventEmitter class

In Node.js, the `EventEmitter` class provides the core functionalities for working with event emitters. It's a built-in class that you can inherit from to create custom objects that can emit and listen for events.

**Here's a breakdown of the `EventEmitter` class:**

- **Inheritance:** You can create custom event emitters by extending the `EventEmitter` class. Your class inherits all the event-related methods from `EventEmitter`.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require("events");

class MyCustomEmitter extends EventEmitter {
  // Your custom logic here
}
```

- **Methods:** The `EventEmitter` class provides essential methods for managing events:
  - `emit(eventName, ...args)`: This method triggers an event with the specified `eventName`. You can optionally pass additional arguments (`args`) that will be provided to the listener functions.
  - `on(eventName, listenerFunction)`: This method registers a listener function for a particular `eventName`. The listener function will be called whenever the event is emitted.
  - `once(eventName, listenerFunction)`: Similar to `on`, but the listener function will be called only the first time the event is emitted and then automatically removed.
  - `off(eventName, listenerFunction)`: This method removes a previously registered listener function for a specific `eventName`.
  - `removeAllListeners(eventName)`: This method removes all listeners registered for a particular `eventName`.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
const myEmitter = new MyCustomEmitter();

// Emit an event
myEmitter.emit("dataReceived", { message: "Hello from emitter!" });

// Register listeners
myEmitter.on("dataReceived", (data) => {
  console.log("Received data:", data.message);
});

myEmitter.once("error", (err) => {
  console.error("Error occurred:", err.message);
});
```

**Beyond the Built-in Class:**

- While the built-in `EventEmitter` class is widely used, there are also third-party libraries like `eventemitter3` that offer additional features and enhancements, such as typed events or wildcard event listeners.

### Common use cases

Event emitters are a versatile tool in Node.js for building applications that require communication and coordination between different parts.

**1. Real-time Communication:**

- Event emitters are ideal for building real-time features like chat applications or collaborative editing tools.
  - The server acts as the event emitter, triggering events like "newMessage" or "documentChange".
  - Connected clients (web browsers) act as listeners, registering functions to be called when these events occur, enabling them to receive and display updates in real-time.

**2. Task Queues and Worker Management:**

- You can leverage event emitters to manage asynchronous tasks and worker processes.
  - A task queue emits events whenever a new task is added.
  - Worker processes act as listeners, waiting for "newTask" events.
  - Upon receiving the event, a worker can pick up the task and process it, ensuring efficient task execution and load balancing.

**3. Modular and Reusable Components:**

- Event emitters promote modularity by enabling components to communicate through events instead of tight coupling.
  - A component can emit events to signal changes or request actions.
  - Other components can listen for these events and react accordingly, creating a loosely coupled and reusable architecture.

**4. State Management (Simple Applications):**

- For smaller applications, event emitters can be used for basic state management.
  - A central event emitter can store and manage application state.
  - UI components can listen for state change events and update themselves accordingly.

**5. Custom Events and Notifications:**

- You can create custom event-driven systems for various purposes.
  - A file upload process might emit events for "uploadStarted", "uploadProgress", and "uploadCompleted", allowing other parts of your application to track the upload status.
  - A form validation process could emit events for specific validation errors, enabling targeted error messages in the UI.

# Streams

Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling data that arrives or is generated in a continuous flow.

1. **Core Concepts:**

   - **Readable Stream:** Represents a source of data that emits chunks of data over time. Imagine a water pipe continuously flowing with water.
   - **Writable Stream:** Represents a destination for data that receives chunks of data and writes them to a specific location (e.g., a file, network socket). Think of a drain that receives and processes the flowing water.
   - **Duplex Stream:** Combines both readable and writable functionalities, allowing data to flow in both directions.
   - **Transform Stream:** A type of duplex stream that can modify or transform the data flowing through it as it's processed.

2. **Stream Events:**

   - Streams emit events to signal their state and data flow. Common events include:
     - `data`: Emitted when a chunk of data is available to be read.
     - `end`: Emitted when the readable stream finishes sending all data.
     - `error`: Emitted if an error occurs during the stream operation.

3. **Stream Pipelines:**

   - You can chain multiple streams together to create pipelines for processing data. Each stream in the pipeline performs an operation on the data before passing it to the next stream.

4. **Backpressure:**

   - This is a crucial concept when dealing with readable streams. It's a mechanism that prevents a fast producer (data source) from overwhelming a slow consumer (data destination). Backpressure allows the consumer to signal the producer to slow down the data flow.

5. **Common Stream Types:**

   - Node.js provides built-in stream types for various use cases, including:
     - `fs.createReadStream`: Reads data from a file.
     - `fs.createWriteStream`: Writes data to a file.
     - `process.stdin`: Reads data from the standard input stream (usually user input).
     - `process.stdout`: Writes data to the standard output stream (usually the console).
     - `http.IncomingMessage`: Represents the readable stream for incoming data from an HTTP request.
     - `http.ServerResponse`: Represents the writable stream for sending data back to the client in an HTTP response.

6. **Third-Party Stream Libraries:**

   - Popular libraries like `stream` and `readable-stream` offer additional functionalities and utilities for working with streams.

7. **Async/Await with Streams:**
   - Async/await syntax can be used effectively to handle asynchronous operations within stream pipelines, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Concepts

**1. The Stream Trio:Readable, Writable, and Duplex**

- **Readable Streams:** Imagine a data source like a file or a network connection that continuously generates data in chunks. A readable stream represents this data source. It emits the `data` event whenever a new chunk of data is available to be read.

  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");

  const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("data.txt");

  readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString()); // Process the data chunk
  });
  ```

  In this example, `fs.createReadStream` creates a readable stream from the "data.txt" file. The `on` method is used to listen for the `data` event. Whenever a chunk of data is available, the listener function is called with the data chunk as an argument.

- **Writable Streams:** Think of a writable stream as a destination for data. It allows you to write data chunks to a specific location, such as a file or a network socket. Writable streams emit an `end` event when all data has been written.

  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");

  const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");

  writableStream.write("This data will be written to the file.\n");
  writableStream.end("This is the end of the data.\n");

  writableStream.on("end", () => {
    console.log("Data written successfully!");
  });
  ```

  Here, `fs.createWriteStream` creates a writable stream for the "output.txt" file. The `write` method is used to write data chunks to the stream. The `end` method indicates that no more data will be written. Finally, an `end` event listener is used to handle the successful completion of the writing process.

- **Duplex Streams:** These versatile streams can both read and write data. They combine the functionalities of readable and writable streams, allowing data to flow in both directions.

  ```javascript
  const net = require("net");

  const socket = net
    .createServer((stream) => {
      stream.on("data", (data) => {
        console.log("Received data from client:", data.toString());
        stream.write("Data received from client and echoed back.\n");
      });
    })
    .listen(8080);
  ```

  This example creates a duplex stream using a TCP socket server. The server listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, a duplex stream (`stream`) is established. The server listens for `data` events on the stream, reads data sent by the client, and then writes a response back to the client using the same stream.

**2. Transform Streams:**

Transform streams are a special type of duplex stream that can modify or transform the data flowing through them. They provide a powerful way to process data on the fly within a stream pipeline.

### Stream events

Stream events are crucial signals emitted by streams in Node.js to communicate their state and data flow. Understanding these events is essential for effectively working with streams and handling data asynchronously.

1. **`data` Event:**

   - This is the most fundamental event for readable streams. It indicates that a new chunk of data is available to be read from the stream.
   - The event listener function receives the data chunk as an argument. This chunk is typically a Buffer object containing a portion of the overall data.

   ```javascript
   const fs = require("fs");

   const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("data.txt");

   readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
     console.log(chunk.toString()); // Process the data chunk
   });
   ```

   In this example, whenever a new chunk of data is available from the "data.txt" file, the listener function will be called with the data chunk. You can process the data chunk within the listener function.

2. **`end` Event:**

   - This event signifies that the readable stream has finished sending all its data. There will be no more `data` events emitted after this.
   - The `end` event listener function is called without any arguments.

   ```javascript
   readableStream.on("end", () => {
     console.log("All data from the stream has been read!");
   });
   ```

   The `end` event listener here is used to indicate that the entire file has been read and processed.

3. **`error` Event:**

   - This event is emitted if an error occurs during the stream operation. It can happen on both readable and writable streams due to various reasons (e.g., file access errors, network issues).
   - The event listener function receives an Error object as an argument, providing details about the error.

   ```javascript
   readableStream.on("error", (err) => {
     console.error("Error reading stream:", err.message);
   });
   ```

   The `error` event listener is crucial for handling unexpected issues during the stream operation. It allows you to log the error, terminate the stream processing gracefully, or take other corrective actions.

### Stream pipelines

Stream pipelines are a powerful concept in Node.js that allow you to chain multiple streams together to create a data processing workflow. Each stream in the pipeline performs an operation on the data before passing it to the next stream. This enables you to build complex data processing tasks in a modular and efficient way.

1. **Chaining Streams:**

Imagine a series of processing steps for data, like reading a file, compressing it, and then writing it to another file. You can achieve this using a stream pipeline:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const zlib = require("zlib");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("data.txt");
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("data.txt.gz");

readableStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writableStream);
```

In this example, we create three streams:
_ A readable stream (`readableStream`) to read the "data.txt" file.
_ A writable stream (`writableStream`) to write the compressed data to "data.txt.gz". \* A transform stream (`gzip`) created using `zlib.createGzip()` to compress the data on the fly.

We then use the `pipe` method to connect these streams. Data from `readableStream` is piped to `gzip`, where it's compressed. The compressed data is then piped to `writableStream` for writing to the compressed file.

2. **Error Handling:**

   Errors can occur at any point in the pipeline. It's essential to handle them appropriately to prevent the entire pipeline from failing.

   ```javascript
   readableStream.pipe(gzip).pipe(writableStream);

   readableStream.on("error", (err) => {
     console.error("Error reading file:", err.message);
     // Handle the error (e.g., stop the pipeline, log the error)
   });

   gzip.on("error", (err) => {
     console.error("Error during compression:", err.message);
     // Handle the error (e.g., stop the pipeline, log the error)
   });

   writableStream.on("error", (err) => {
     console.error("Error writing compressed data:", err.message);
     // Handle the error (e.g., stop the pipeline, log the error)
   });
   ```

   Here, we've added error listeners to each stream in the pipeline. If an error occurs during reading, compressing, or writing, the corresponding error listener will be triggered, allowing you to take appropriate actions.

3. **Benefits of Stream Pipelines:**

   - **Modular Design:** Break down complex data processing tasks into smaller, reusable stream operations.
   - **Efficient Memory Usage:** Streams process data in chunks, avoiding loading the entire dataset into memory at once.
   - **Readability:** Stream pipelines provide a clear flow for data processing, improving code readability and maintainability.

### Back pressure

In Node.js streams, backpressure is a crucial mechanism that prevents a fast producer (data source) from overwhelming a slow consumer (data destination). It ensures efficient data flow and avoids memory issues.

**The Scenario:**

Imagine you have a stream that reads a large file very quickly (producer) and another stream that writes the data to a disk (consumer). If the producer sends data chunks faster than the consumer can write them to disk, the following problems can arise:

- **Memory Overload:** The consumer's buffer will fill up with data chunks it can't process yet, potentially leading to a memory leak or application crash.
- **Data Loss:** If the buffer overflows, new data chunks might be dropped, resulting in data loss.

**Backpressure to the Rescue:**

This is where backpressure comes in. When the consumer's buffer reaches a certain threshold (high-water mark), it signals the producer to slow down by pausing the stream. This pause prevents the producer from sending more data until the consumer has processed some of the existing data in its buffer and has space for more.

**The Flow:**

1. **Producer Sends Data:** The producer stream (e.g., reading a file) emits chunks of data.
2. **Consumer Processes Data:** The consumer stream (e.g., writing to disk) receives the data chunks and processes them.
3. **Buffer Fills Up:** As the consumer processes data, its internal buffer fills up with data chunks waiting to be written.
4. **High-Water Mark Reached:** When the buffer reaches a predefined high-water mark limit, the consumer emits a `'drain'` event.
5. **Producer Pauses:** The producer receives the `'drain'` event and pauses sending data chunks.
6. **Consumer Writes Data:** The consumer continues processing the data in its buffer, freeing up space.
7. **Buffer Lowers:** Once the buffer level falls below a low-water mark (optional), the consumer might emit a `'resume'` event.
8. **Producer Resumes:** The producer receives the `'resume'` event (if emitted) and starts sending data again.

**Benefits of Backpressure:**

- **Prevents Memory Leaks:** Ensures the consumer's buffer doesn't overflow, avoiding memory-related issues.
- **Prevents Data Loss:** Data chunks are sent only when the consumer is ready, minimizing the risk of data loss.
- **Improves Performance:** Enables a smooth data flow by matching the producer's speed with the consumer's processing capacity.

**Backpressure in Practice:**

By default, Node.js streams handle backpressure automatically. The `Writable` stream implements the backpressure mechanism using the `'drain'` and (optional) `'resume'` events. However, in some cases, you might want to adjust the high-water mark or implement custom backpressure logic for specific scenarios.

### Common stream types

Node.js provides various built-in stream types that cater to different data sources and destinations, allowing you to work with data efficiently in a streaming manner.

**Readable Streams:**

- Represent sources of data that emit chunks of data over time. They are ideal for scenarios where data is generated or retrieved continuously, such as reading from files or network connections.

  - `fs.createReadStream(path)`: Creates a readable stream for reading data from a file.
  - `process.stdin`: Represents the standard input stream, typically used for user input from the console.
  - `http.IncomingMessage`: A readable stream for incoming data from an HTTP request.

**Writable Streams:**

- Act as destinations for data, receiving chunks of data and writing them to a specific location.

  - `fs.createWriteStream(path)`: Creates a writable stream for writing data to a file.
  - `process.stdout`: Represents the standard output stream, usually used for writing data to the console.
  - `http.ServerResponse`: A writable stream for sending data back to the client in an HTTP response.

**Duplex Streams:**

- Combine both readable and writable functionalities, allowing data to flow in both directions. They are useful for scenarios like real-time communication where data exchange happens in both directions.

  - `net.Socket`: Represents a TCP socket connection, which can be used for both reading and writing data over a network.
  - `tls.Socket`: Similar to `net.Socket` but provides secure communication using TLS/SSL.

**Transform Streams:**

- A special type of duplex stream that can modify or transform the data flowing through it as it's processed. They are powerful for tasks like data encryption, compression, or filtering.

  - `zlib.createGzip()`: Creates a transform stream for compressing data using the Gzip algorithm.
  - `zlib.createGunzip()`: Creates a transform stream for decompressing Gzip-compressed data.

**Other Stream Types:**

- Node.js offers additional stream types for specific purposes, such as:
  - `PassThrough`: A simple transform stream that passes data through without modification.
  - `DeferredStream`: A writable stream that allows delaying the underlying destination until the stream is explicitly activated.

**Choosing the Right Stream Type:**

The appropriate stream type depends on your specific use case. Consider the data source, destination, and any necessary data transformations when selecting the most suitable stream type for your needs.

### Third-party stream libraries

### Async/await with streams

Async/await syntax is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and it can be effectively used with streams in Node.js to create cleaner, more readable code.

**Challenges with Callbacks:**

Traditionally, stream operations in Node.js relied on callbacks for handling asynchronous events like `data`, `end`, and `error`. While functional, this approach can lead to nested callbacks, making code harder to read and maintain, especially in complex stream pipelines.

**Enter Async/Await:**

Async/await syntax provides a more synchronous-like way to handle asynchronous operations. It allows you to use `await` on promises returned by stream methods, pausing the execution of the async function until the promise resolves.

**Example: Reading a File with Async/Await:**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs").promises; // Using fs.promises for cleaner async/await usage

async function readFile(path) {
  try {
    const readableStream = fs.createReadStream(path);
    let data = "";

    for await (const chunk of readableStream) {
      data += chunk.toString();
    }

    console.log(data);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err.message);
  }
}

readFile("data.txt");
```

In this example:

- `fs.promises` provides async versions of file system methods.
- The `readFile` function is declared as `async`, allowing the use of `await`.
- `createReadStream` returns a readable stream.
- We use a `for await...of` loop to iterate over the data chunks emitted by the stream.
- `await` pauses the function until each chunk is read.
- The loop accumulates the data chunks into a single string.

**Benefits of Async/Await with Streams:**

- **Improved Readability:** Code becomes more linear and easier to follow compared to nested callbacks.
- **Error Handling:** `try...catch` blocks can be used for better error handling within the async function.
- **Cleaner Code:** Avoids the clutter of multiple callback functions.

**Important Considerations:**

- Async/await can only be used with functions that return promises. Ensure the stream methods you're using have promise-based versions (e.g., `fs.promises` instead of `fs`).
- While async/await simplifies asynchronous code, it's still essential to understand the underlying asynchronous nature of streams.
