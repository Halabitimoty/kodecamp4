The syntax for generators in JavaScript is quite straightforward:

1. **`function*` declaration:**

- We define a generator function using the `function*` syntax. The asterisk (`*`) after the `function` keyword indicates that this is a generator function.

2. **`yield` keyword:**

- Inside the generator function's body, we use the `yield` keyword to pause execution and return a value. The `yield` keyword can be used multiple times to yield different values throughout the function.

3. **Regular function body:**

- The rest of the generator function's body can contain regular JavaScript code, including variables, loops, conditional statements, etc.

Here's an example to illustrate the syntax:

```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1; // Pauses execution and returns 1
  console.log("After first yield"); // This line executes after the first yield
  yield 2; // Pauses execution and returns 2
}
```

In this example:

- The `numberGenerator` is a generator function because of `function*`.
- It yields the value `1` at the first `yield` statement, pausing execution.
- The line `console.log("After first yield")` executes only after the first `next()` call on the generator object (since execution pauses at `yield`).
- It then yields the value `2` at the second `yield` statement.

**Calling a Generator Function:**

It's important to remember that calling a generator function doesn't execute the entire function like a regular function. Instead, it returns a generator object, which is an iterator.

You can use the `next()` method on the generator object to resume execution and get the yielded values. Each call to `next()` advances the generator to the next `yield` statement and returns the value yielded there.
